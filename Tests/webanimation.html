    What are fruits you ask. Merriam-Webster gives 4 definitions of fruits! I will list 3 as the last
    one is offensive!
<ol>
    <li>a product of plant growth (such as grain, vegetables, or cotton)</li>
    <li>offspring</li>
    <li>the state of bearing fruit also relating to the effect or consequence of an action or operation
    </li>
</ol>
For more information check out <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fruit">Merriam-Webster's
    definition of fruit</a>!
</p>

<p>
    I love fruits! If I could eat something for the rest of my life and never get tired of them.... I
    would eat fruits!
    Not the ones you find here in the States, but the ones found in most tropical countries. After
    moving here I came to
    realize how limited fruits are here which kinda sucks.
    Because I know you're dying to hear this, here's a some of my favourite fruits, in no particular
    order:)
<ul>
    <li>Mangoes</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Papayas</li>
    <li>Pineapples</li>
    <li>Guava</li>
    <li>Grapes --- only seeedlessss pleaseeee</li>
    <li>Literally most fruits lol except avocadoes</li>
</ul>

    What are vegetables you ask? Merriam-Webster says veggies are a usually herbaceous plant (such as the
    cabbage, bean, or potato) grown for an edible part that is usually eaten as part of a meal.
    For more information check out <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vegetable">Merriam-Webster's
        definition of
        vegetable</a>!
</p>

<p>
    I'm not going to lie, I don't care for veggies as much as I care for fruits! I like most veggies raw
    because I like the crunchy taste of it all. I don't like boiled veggies but can handle steamed. The way
    I get veggies into my system are through smoothies or juices. I have a handy-dandy juicer and I
    literally juice anything and everything. If I can't juice it I make a smoothie or find some sort of
    interesting way to digest it lol.
    I won't bore you with a list about veggies but here's a cool table I made about different fruits and
    veggie that have the same colour!:)
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead class="thead-dark">
        <tr>
            <th> Colour </th>
            <th> Fruit </th>
            <th> Vegetable </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr class="table-danger">
        <td> <span style="color: red"> Red </span> </td>
        <td> Apple </td>
        <td> Tomato </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="table-success">
        <td> <span style="color: green"> Green </span> </td>
        <td> Green Apples </td>
        <td> Cucumber </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    I'm sure you need a couple of pictures of the given fruits and veggies!
