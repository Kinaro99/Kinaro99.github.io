        What are fruits you ask. Merriam-Webster gives 4 definitions of fruits! I will list 3 as the last
        one is offensive!
    <ol>
        <li>a product of plant growth (such as grain, vegetables, or cotton)</li>
        <li>offspring</li>
        <li>the state of bearing fruit also relating to the effect or consequence of an action or operation
        </li>
    </ol>
    For more information check out <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fruit">Merriam-Webster's
        definition of fruit</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
        I love fruits! If I could eat something for the rest of my life and never get tired of them.... I
        would eat fruits!
        Not the ones you find here in the States, but the ones found in most tropical countries. After
        moving here I came to
        realize how limited fruits are here which kinda sucks.
        Because I know you're dying to hear this, here's a some of my favourite fruits, in no particular
        order:)
    <ul>
        <li>Mangoes</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Papayas</li>
        <li>Pineapples</li>
        <li>Guava</li>
        <li>Grapes --- only seeedlessss pleaseeee</li>
        <li>Literally most fruits lol except avocadoes</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        What are vegetables you ask? Merriam-Webster says veggies are a usually herbaceous plant (such as the
        cabbage, bean, or potato) grown for an edible part that is usually eaten as part of a meal.
        For more information check out <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vegetable">Merriam-Webster's
            definition of
            vegetable</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm not going to lie, I don't care for veggies as much as I care for fruits! I like most veggies raw
        because I like the crunchy taste of it all. I don't like boiled veggies but can handle steamed. The way
        I get veggies into my system are through smoothies or juices. I have a handy-dandy juicer and I
        literally juice anything and everything. If I can't juice it I make a smoothie or find some sort of
        interesting way to digest it lol.
        I won't bore you with a list about veggies but here's a cool table I made about different fruits and
        veggie that have the same colour!:)
    </p>

    <table class="table">
        <thead class="thead-dark">
            <tr>
                <th> Colour </th>
                <th> Fruit </th>
                <th> Vegetable </th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr class="table-danger">
            <td> <span style="color: red"> Red </span> </td>
            <td> Apple </td>
            <td> Tomato </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="table-success">
            <td> <span style="color: green"> Green </span> </td>
            <td> Green Apples </td>
            <td> Cucumber </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        I'm sure you need a couple of pictures of the given fruits and veggies!
