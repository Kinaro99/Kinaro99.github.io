                What are fruits you ask. Merriam-Webster gives 4 definitions of fruits! I will list 3 as the last
                one is offensive!
            <ol>
                <li>a product of plant growth (such as grain, vegetables, or cotton)</li>
                <li>offspring</li>
                <li>the state of bearing fruit also relating to the effect or consequence of an action or operation
                </li>
            </ol>
            For more information about the definition of fruit, check Merriam-Webster out!

                I love fruits! If I could eat something for the rest of my life and never get tired of them.... I
                would eat fruits!
                Not the ones you find here in the States, but the ones found in most tropical countries. After
                moving here I came to
                realize how limited fruits are here which kinda sucks.
                Because I know you're dying to hear this, here's a some of my favourite fruits, in no particular
                order:)
            <ul>
                <li>Mangoes</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
                <li>Papayas</li>
                <li>Pineapples</li>
                <li>Guava</li>
                <li>Grapes --- only seeedlessss pleaseeee</li>
                <li>Literally most fruits lol except avocadoes</li>

                What are vegetables you ask. Merriam-Webster says veggies are a usually herbaceous plant (such as the
                cabbage, bean, or potato) grown for an edible part that is usually eaten as part of a meal
                For more information about the definition of vegetables, check Merriam-Webster out!
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm not going to lie, I don't care for veggies as much as I care for fruits! I like most veggies raw
                because I like the crunchy taste of it all. I don't like boiled veggies but can handle steamed. The way
                I get veggies into my system are through smoothies or juices. I have a handy-dandy juicer and I
                literally juice anything and everything. If I can't juice it I make a smoothie or find some sort of
                interesting way to digest it lol.
                I won't bore you with a list about veggies but here's a cool table I made about different fruits and veggie that have the same colour!:)

                OOOOOOO you thought I was done? Here's a picture of a mango! But first, here's a short paragraph
                about
                Mangoes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Rajan Karle describes his favorite fruit in a short paragrph and says,
                "Mango consists of huge amounts of vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D. There are more than
                hundred
                varieties of mangoes. These varieties are on the basis of colors, shapes, sizes, and many other
                specifications. It is my favorite fruit because it is sweet, appetizing, and healthy.
                Since summer is the only season when mangoes become available in the market, I eat a lot of
                mangoes.
                We
                can
                use this fruit in two ways. We can either eat ripe mangoes directly or use unripe mangoes for
                preparing
                pickles, sauces or juices. Mango pulp and its juice supply instant energy to cope with the heat
                during
                the
                summer months.
                Among all other fruits, mango is considered as the king of fruits. We can plant a mango tree in
                any
                place.
                Mango tree belongs to the genus of perennial plants. Their leaves are evergreen. A normal mango
                tree
                can
                have a height of about 15-30 meters. These trees provide fruits during the summer months when
                the
                climate is
                warm. Also, these trees flower during the winter season."
