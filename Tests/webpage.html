            Intel is a company that specilizes in the creation of computer processors and are one of the pioneers 
            of modern computers.
        </p>
        <ol>
            For more detailed information about intel, please visit <a

            I rather like intel, as I have been a user of their products and many machines that utilize
            thier products over many years. However, while at one point they were very good at being an 
            amazing manufacturer, their golden years are certainly behind them. They have made a multitude
            of poor choices in the past few years that has made their modern processors a bit of a joke 
            compared to newer chips on the market. A good example is the Apple M1 all-in-one microprocessor,
            which has become Apples new uniqe chip. Something that Apple has not had for many many years.
            This new chip has replaced Intel in Apple's lineup of future systems, and needless to say
            intel was not happy about being both given the boot and being outclassed by a superior chip.
            Hopefully Intel may work out their kinks and become a good company again, but time will tell.

                What are fruits you ask. Merriam-Webster gives 4 definitions of fruits! I will list 3 as the last
                one is offensive!
            <ol>
                <li>a product of plant growth (such as grain, vegetables, or cotton)</li>
                <li>offspring</li>
                <li>the state of bearing fruit also relating to the effect or consequence of an action or operation
                </li>
            </ol>
            For more information about the definition of fruit, check out <a
                href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fruit">Merriam-Webster</a>
            out!

                I love fruits! If I could eat something for the rest of my life and never get tired of them.... I
                would eat fruits!
                Not the ones you find here in the States, but the ones found in most tropical countries. After
                moving here I came to
                realize how limited fruits are here which kinda sucks.
                Because I know you're dying to hear this, here's a some of my favourite fruits, in no particular
                order:)
            <ul>
                <li>Mangoes</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
                <li>Papayas</li>
                <li>Pineapples</li>
                <li>Guava</li>
                <li>Grapes --- only seeedlessss pleaseeee</li>
                <li>Literally most fruits lol except avocadoes</li>

            <p>
                What are vegetables you ask? Merriam-Webster says veggies are a usually herbaceous plant (such as the
                cabbage, bean, or potato) grown for an edible part that is usually eaten as part of a meal.
                For more information about the definition of fruit, check out <a

            </p>

            <p>
                I'm not going to lie, I don't care for veggies as much as I care for fruits! I like most veggies raw
                because I like the crunchy taste of it all. I don't like boiled veggies but can handle steamed. The way
                I get veggies into my system are through smoothies or juices. I have a handy-dandy juicer and I
                literally juice anything and everything. If I can't juice it I make a smoothie or find some sort of
                interesting way to digest it lol.
                I won't bore you with a list about veggies but here's a cool table I made about different fruits and
                veggie that have the same colour!:)
